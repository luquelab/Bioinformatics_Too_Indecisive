# Bioinformatics_Too_Indecisive

This is a group project developed by Xin, Stanley, Nabila, and Zixian for BIL 652 at University of Miami. Our project focuses on gene function annotation from nucleotide sequences using bioinformatics pipelines.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This bioinformatics tool takes raw nucleotide sequences in `.fna` format as input and performs functional annotation to identify gene characteristics and associated biological functions.

It is designed for researchers and students needing a simple, reproducible workflow to parse and analyze gene sequences. The project uses a Jupyter Notebook pipeline accessible via Google Colab.

## 🧬 Input

- **File format:** `.fna` — FASTA format nucleotide sequences
- **Example file:** `sequences.fna`
- This file contains concatenated gene sequences for functional analysis.

## 🧪 Output

- Functionally annotated genes with:
  - Predicted gene functions
  - Sequence features and possible biological roles
  - Intermediate parsing and processing steps shown in the notebook

## ⚙️ How to Use

1. Clone the repository or open the notebook on Google Colab.
2. Upload your `.fna` file when prompted.
3. Follow the step-by-step instructions inside the notebook.
4. View and interpret the functional annotations from the output.
